This process is essential for life on Earth, as it provides energy and organic compounds for the food chain.\n",

            "2. **Electron Transfer**: The absorbed light energy excites electrons, which are then transferred to a special molecule called an electron acceptor.\n",
            "3. **ATP Synthesis**: The energy from the excited electrons is used to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and Pi (inorganic phosphate).\n",

            "2. **Reduction of 3-PGA**: The 3-PGA molecules are reduced to form glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) using the ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions.\n",
            "3. **Regeneration of RuBP**: The enzyme RuBP is regenerated so that the cycle can continue.\n",
            "4. **Production of Glucose**: Two molecules of G3P are combined to form one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6).\n",
